 Citizen Register Management

Description:

The Java project I have developed is a robust and user-friendly Citizen Registry System. This system provides a comprehensive set of features to manage citizen information efficiently. With an intuitive menu-driven interface, users can easily perform various operations on the registry.

1) Add new Citizen into the Registry:
This option allows users to add a new citizen to the registry. It prompts the user to enter relevant details such as the citizen's name, address, and unique identification number. Once the information is provided, it is securely stored in the registry.

2) Delete Citizen from the Registry:
With this option, users can remove a citizen from the registry. It prompts the user to input the citizen's unique identification number (AFM) and verifies its existence in the registry. If found, the citizen's information is deleted, ensuring the registry remains up to date.

3) Update Citizens AFM or Address:
This feature enables users to update the unique identification number (AFM) or address of a citizen. The system prompts the user to enter the citizen's current AFM and provides options to modify either the AFM or address. Once the changes are made, the registry is updated accordingly.

4) Search Citizen into the Registry:
Users can perform a search within the registry using this option. They are prompted to enter the citizen's unique identification number (AFM), and the system checks if the citizen exists in the registry. If found, the citizen's information is displayed, allowing users to access the details easily.

5) Print the Registry:
This functionality allows users to print the entire citizen registry. By selecting this option, a neatly formatted list of all citizens and their associated information is displayed, offering a comprehensive overview of the registered individuals.

6) Save and Exit:
This final option ensures the safe preservation of all modifications made to the registry. When selected, the system saves any changes and gracefully exits the program, preserving the data for future usage.

Overall, this Java project delivers a user-friendly menu-driven interface that empowers users to efficiently manage a Citizen Registry System. Its range of features, including adding, deleting, updating, searching, and printing citizen information, ensures the smooth and organized management of citizens' data.
